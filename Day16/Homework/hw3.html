    <p>
        The fillings of khinkali vary with the area. The original recipe, the so-called khevsuruli, consisted of only minced meat<br>
        (lamb or beef and pork mixed), onions, chili pepper, salt, and cumin.[3] However,<br>
        the modern recipe used mostly especially in Georgian urban areas,the so-called kalakuri,
        uses herbs like parsley and coriander.<br>
        Mushrooms, potatoes, or cheese may be used in place of meat.

        Etiquette

    <p>
        Khinkali is eaten plain or with ground black pepper. The meat filling is uncooked when khinkali is assembled,<br>
        so when it is cooked, the juices of the meat are trapped inside the dumpling. To make khinkali juicier,<br>
        usually warm water or broth is added to the minced meat. Khinkali is typically consumed first by sucking the juices<br>
        while taking the first bite, similar to xiaolongbao, in order to prevent the dumpling from bursting. The top, where<br>
        the pleats meet, is tough, and is not supposed to be eaten, but discarded to the plate so that those eating can count<br>
        how many they have consumed. In Georgia, this top is called the kudi (Georgian: კუდი, "tail") or k'uch'i(Georgian: კუჭი, "stomach").<br>
        There is a widespread etiquette in Georgia to use only one's bare hands while consuming these dumplings.<br>
        The using of utensils, like a fork, is considered incorrect or childish. This is because juice is an important part of khinkali;<br>
        using a fork will rupture the khinkali and the juice will be spilled.<br>

        Origins
    </h2>

    <p>
        The origins of the khinkali are not clear: some consider it a result of the Mongolian conquests, <br>
        and others support it was created in the Georgian mountains. <br>
        According to some legends, khinkali originates from Mongolia and reached Georgia around the 13th century <br>
        (Georgia being located on the Silk Road).[4] Mongolian conquerors would put their meat in dough in order to better conserve <br>
        it while riding their horses.[5][6] They themselves probably learned to make dumplings from their Chinese neighbors. <br>
        However, according to other sources, the traditional dish was invented in the Georgian mountains north of Tbilisi. <br>
        It used to be a dish eaten mostly by shepherds during cold and snowy winters. <br>
        The invention is disputed by both people from the Tusheti and the Pshavi regions. <br>
        Initially, khinkalis were stuffed with lamb as it was the most common meat eaten in the mountains. <br>
        Then, variations were created as it became more popular and reached urban areas.[7] Thus, <br>
        pork or beef began to be used as a stuffing, and then vegetarian versions were developed. <br>
