    <p class="titles"> Cloud Backup Services </p>
    <p">
        The cloud is a versatile platform capable of supporting numerous virtual services,
        such as operating systems and programs. Cloud backups are one part of the service model too,
        allowing users and companies to store their important information on external cloud servers,
        circumventing hardware failure or other problems. Cloud backup is typically handled by service
        providers for monthly/annual fees.

    <p class="titles"> VoIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol)</p>
    </p>
        The internet and broadband connections allow for versatile communication methods, and VoIP is one of them.
        This IT service utilizes a business/person’s internet in place of a traditional telephone line, allowing
        said user to make and receive calls with their ISP. Modern VoIP phones also provide a variety of functions,
        like voice call and chat options. Typically, VoIP’s also require a service subscription instead of a traditional phone service.

    <p class="titles"> Monitoring Services </p>
    <p>
        Similar to security services and also found with an MSP, a monitoring application does as it sounds:
        keeps an eye on servers, net traffic, communication, security, and/or anything needed by an enterprise.
        This service is often employed for smaller companies who lack the resources of
        larger organizations but still require robust IT support/features.
        Responsibilities can range from automatically updating software/anti-virus to
        monitoring the integrity of hardware with SMART programs.

    <p class="titles"> Data Backup and Restoration </p>
    <p>
        Some providers offer data backup with cloud or others with external data centers. Regardless of the method used,
        data backup involves the preservation of information in case of unforeseen problems, such as natural disaster,
        malicious intrusions, hardware failure, and more. Often a business refers to this as a “BDR strategy” (backup disaster recovery).
        For most organizations, having some form of backup is mandatory in order to prevent issues like downtime and critical information loss.

    <p class="titles"> Firewall Services </p>
    <p>
        Firewalls are a common, integral part of any cybersecurity plan. Most companies handle their own or have a firewall
        for their network – but in some cases will elect a third party for additional firewall options. Options vary based on the provider.
        Some firewalls are hybrid models, for instance, which allow for additional control and network monitoring
        options outside of the normal rulesets. Others may provide a single firewall solution for all internal/remote devices.
        The needs differ based on the requirements of each individual company.
